This is my learning project after the first day of knowing about one of the best and popular CSS framework called <b>Tailwind CSS.<b>
I have applied the tailwind css fully on this mini project without creating any additional external CSS file. But yes, yet to explore the tailwind css. Its just the start. 
The project is live here
